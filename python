Problem Statement



Jade, a physics enthusiast, is analyzing the dynamics of a jump using an advanced energy model. The energy required for a jump is a function of the takeoff speed and weight. The model uses the square of the takeoff speed, multiplied by the weight, and then divided by 20 to determine the initial energy.



Given the initial energy, and the weight of the jumper, calculate the takeoff speed.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a float A, representing the initial energy of the model (in units).

The second line of input consists of a float W, representing the weight of the jumper (in units).

Output format :
The output displays "Takeoff speed: " followed by a float representing the calculated original takeoff speed with two decimal place"""

# You are using Python
initial_energy = float(input())
weight = float(input())

speed = (initial_energy * 20) / weight
takeoff_speed = speed ** 0.5

print(f"Takeoff speed: {takeoff_speed:.2f}")
